The process consists of three stages:
    1) SCRAPING jsons from Rom2Rio.com (scraping.py)
    2) direct routes EXTRACTION from the scraped jsons (extraction.py)
    3) obtained data TREATMENT with the purpose to create the datasets for validation etc (treatment.py)

All nessecary input files are stored in directory 'files/csv'.
All output files are stored in the folder 'output'.

Whole process can be runed with only one 'scrapRome2Rio.py' script.

Also there is an script 'fixing.py' fixing prices for the specific routes stored in csv file(s) by path "files/routes_to_fix/". 
    By default '$python3 fixing.py' takes 'routes_to_fix.csv' as input file.
    Running '$python3 fixing.py -b' makes possible to process of multiple files in a batch.
    The name of the csv files in such case have to be in following format: 'routes_to_fix_[filename].csv'
