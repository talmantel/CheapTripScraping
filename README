The process consists of three stages:
    1) SCRAPING jsons from Rom2Rio.com (scraping.py)
    2) direct routes EXTRACTION from the scraped jsons (extraction.py)
    3) obtained data TREATMENT with the purpose to create the datasets for validation etc (treatment.py)

All nessecary input files are stored in directory 'files/csv'.
All output files are stored in the folder 'output':
    - all_direct_routes_raw.csv - non-ordered file with all avaliable 'raw' data each direct route (output of extraction.py)
    - all_direct_routes_validation.csv - non-ordered file with only the columns relevant to validation purposes (output of treatment.py)
    - all_direct_routes_triples - file containing ordered by triples (from_id, to_id, transport_id) routes with lowest price (treatment.py)
    - all_direct_

Whole process can be runed with only one 'scrapRome2Rio.py' script.

Also there is an script 'fixing.py' fixing prices for the specific routes stored in csv file(s) by path "files/routes_to_fix/". 
    To do this run:
                     $ python3 fixing.py -f [filename].csv
    Running 
                     $ python3 fixing.py -b 

    makes possible to process of multiple files in a batch.
